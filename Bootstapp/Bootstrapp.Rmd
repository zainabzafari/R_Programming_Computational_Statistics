This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
temperature <- read.csv("D:\\data\\Computational statistics\\temperature.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")
temperature

row.names(temperature) <- temperature$day
temperature <-subset(temperature, select = -day)


#The second argument, 1, tells apply() to perform the operation row-wise (i.e., apply the function to each row). If you wanted to apply it to each column, you'd use 2 instead.
means  <- apply(temperature, 1, mean)
medians <- apply(temperature, 1, median)

means[2]
medians[1]


quantile( means[-1], c(0.1 , 0.9) , type =1)

quantile ( medians[-1], c(0.1 , 0.9) , type =1)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
